Currently bindata is used to store the favicon.ico file. That is all.

- To generate the bindata you need to install mockgen:

```shell
curl --silent --location --output /usr/local/bin/go-bindata https://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata/releases/download/v3.11.0/go-bindata-linux-amd64
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/go-bindata
```
